I obtained my M.S. from the College of Civil Engineering at Hunan University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xuan Kong](http://kongteam.hnu.edu.cn/). During this period, my research mainly focused on the identification of vehicle spatiotemporal distribution based on the `deep learning`-based object detection, deep learning-based low-light image enhancement and `computer vision`. Now, I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Notre Dame, under the supervision of [Prof. Jianxun Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/jianxun-wang/).

You can find more information in my [CV](/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf) here.
