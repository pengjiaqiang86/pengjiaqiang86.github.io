I obtained my M.S. from the College of Civil Engineering at Hunan University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xuan Kong](http://kongteam.hnu.edu.cn/). Now, I'm a Ph.D. student at the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, under the supervision of [Prof. Jianxun Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/jianxun-wang/). Currently, I'm working on differentiable physics and hybrid numerical solvers.

You can find more information in my [CV](/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf) here.
