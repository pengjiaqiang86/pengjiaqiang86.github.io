I obtained my M.Eng. from the College of Civil Engineering at Hunan University, uncder the supervision of [Prof. Xuan Kong](http://kongteam.hnu.edu.cn/). During this period, my research mainly focuses on the identification of vehicle spatiotemporal distribution based on the `deep learning`-based object detection, deep learning-based low-light image enhancement and `computer vision`. Besides, I also have some interests in interdisciplinary research between `scientific machine learning` and `computational solid mechanics`. And Prof. Kong is also conducting relevant research.

You can find more information in my [CV](/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf) here.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
